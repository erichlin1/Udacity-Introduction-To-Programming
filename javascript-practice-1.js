/* operators that take more than 2 values are called * binary operators *.
operators that take in 1 value is called a * unary operators *.

*/

//console.log(true == true);

// although both types are the same, they are not equal.
// console.log(NaN == NaN); 

// There are three logical operators: Unary, binary, ternary.
// example of a ternary operator:


// when the boolen type is true, then the middle value is returned.

// console.log( true ? 1: 2 );
// console.log( true ? 1 : 2 );

// when the boolean type is false, then the right most value is returned.

// console.log( false ? 1 : 2 );
// console.log( false ? 1 : 2 );

// Automatic Type Conversion

console.log( "5" - 1);
