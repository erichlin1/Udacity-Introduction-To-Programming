    - in DOM (Document Object Model), a node represents a HTML element,
    which can be a text, image, etc. 
    
    - These nodes represents a tree structure. 

    - Rulesets are a group of selectors, and an associate declaration block,
    Type selectors indicates once type of html tag.
    
    - Class HTML is an HTML that groups elements together.
    - Id is a unique name for an element. 
    
    NOTE:
    - id attribute always take precedence over class attribute and type selectors.

    
    - use TYPE SELECTOR to apply the same style to all p elements.
    - use CLASS to apply style to multiple p elements, but not all. 
    - use ID to apply a style to single p element. 
    Precedence
    1. ID
    2. CLASS
    3. TYPE SELECTOR

    NOTE:
    - font-size: 1.5em => 1.5 times the default font size.
    - You can apply multiple class attributes to a single element.

    - lower level nodes take behavioral precedence over higher level nodes.
    regardless of the vertical positions defined in the rulesets.

    1 inch = 96 pixels.
    1 em = 12pt

    <em> => emphasis

    width
    height
    Padding - within borders.
    Border
    Margin


    NOTE on COLOR section:

    each of the primary colors can have 256 possible values.
    each color is stored in a single byte

    always add generic font in case the specific doesn't render properly on the web.





    short-hand font declaration format
    font: optional - font-size - font-family;

    Semantic markup - using markup to indicate meaning rather than appearance.

    REVIEW NOTES:
    - Basics CSS Syntax
        - CSS Ruleset contains a selector, a declaration block which contains
            properties, and values.
            - Class Selector
            - Id Selector
                - #Name-of-selector
                - Has to be a unique attribute value.
            - Type Selector
            - Descendant Selector
                - compound of two simpler selectors. 
                - Applies only to an inner element.
