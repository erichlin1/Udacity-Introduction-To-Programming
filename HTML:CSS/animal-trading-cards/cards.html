                Dog (Canis lupus familiaris) are domesticated animals, not natural 
                wild animals. They were originally bred from wolves. They have been 
                bred by humans for a long time, and were the first animals ever to be 
                domesticated. ... They are a popular pet because they are usually playful, 
                friendly, loyal and listen to humans.
