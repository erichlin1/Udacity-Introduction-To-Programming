Draft Introduction #1 - experience

It is with great enthusiasm to apply for the Senior Marketing Designer role at Fast.
In my 2+ years of experience managing multiple ecommerce stores on Etsy, I've expanded
technical skills in digital marketing, progressed my knowledge in fundamental business operations, 
developed competence in distilling data to obtain actionable insights, and 
realized my knack for process optimization. Along with my 2+ years of experience in visual
communication and my expertise of basic client-side development, I am confident that I
can bring Fast's brand to life. 
    1. expressed your knowledge in project management/businss operations
    2. data-driven decision
    3. being more efficient
    4. client side development

My interest in Fast's mission stems from a similar encountered problem during my time managing 
Coffee Meets Mug, LLC and Besties Gift Shop, LLC; that is, simplifying the customer experience
for custom product designs and streamlining the production process. Manually creating 
custom designs became time-consuming. So, I developed a terminal application in Javascript and 
Node.js that interfaces with Adobe Illustrator to automatically generate design files based on 
customers preferences/identifers. This reduced design inaccuracies, decreased fulfillment time 
and more importantly, improved brand equity. This implementation decreased operational costs by 
55%, and lead time by 3 days. 
    1. in this paragraph, you've described yourself as a problem solver
    2. Expressed interest in Fast's mission for simplying the user experience
    3. mentioned brand equity (shows that you understand branding)

As the sole designer, I created digital designs that were relevant to buyer interest, unique and
consistent with brand proposition. This lead to an average revenue of $1,533 per sku, and 10.2%
compound monthly growth rate in 2019. Most of my design decisions were based on examining trends,
analyzing competitive purchase data and characterstics/interests relevant to my minimum viable 
customer.
    1. a data-driven designer
    2. understand that data plays an important role.

Conclusion:

Mention your portfolio, github account to view projects, and re-iterate that you are a data-driven designer
with experience in digital marketing and project management.
