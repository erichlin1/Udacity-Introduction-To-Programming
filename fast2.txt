Draft Introduction #1 - experience

It is with great enthusiasm to apply for the Senior Marketing Designer role at Fast.
In my 2+ years of experience managing multiple ecommerce stores on Etsy, I created 
product designs, generated an average of $1,553 per sku, and hit 10.2% CMGR in 2019. I
found solace in operations with a knack for process optimization and developed a deep
interest in distilling the complexity of customer data to obtain actionable insights. 
Along with my experience in creating marketing collaterials and knowledge of client-side 
development, I am confident that I can bring fast's brand to life. 

My interest in Fast's mission stems from a similar encountered problem - simplifying the 
customer experience and streamlining the production process, albeit for custom product 
designs. During my time operating Coffee Meets Mug LLC, manually creating designs for 
customers became monotonous. Without previous knowledge of software development, I developed
a terminal application in Javascript and Node.js that interfaces with Adobe Illustrator 
to automatically generate design files based on customer's order data. It directly reduced 
design inaccuracies, decreased fulfillment time, improved customer experience, and 
importantly, improved brand equity. Accordingly, I created instructional product content
to lower the barrier-to-purchase. Effectively, this process decreased operational cost by
55% and lead-time by 3 days. 

By defining my target audience, examining trends, and analyzing competitive purchase rate, 
I created designs that were consistent with buyer interest, unique, and relevant to 
brand proposition.
